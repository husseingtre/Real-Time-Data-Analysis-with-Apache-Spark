I work for an insurance company and I don’t know a lot about company cars however - no claims discounts become void if you don’t insure a car, normally after two years. So if your wife has a big no claims bonus built up, that won’t be maintained by her having the company car so you might want to keep the car insured in her name with you as the main driver so that she keeps her no claims.

Some evidence of understanding of the job and passion for the field.  I don’t need or want a paraphrasing of the job spec, just something that demonstrates they understand who and what they are applying for.

Evidence of experience that is put into context of the role.  I don’t want a recital of their CV or a long essay on how great they are, but some signposting that shows how x skill/experience or y job would translate into competence in their new job.

A sense of personal growth, learning and ambition.  I don’t want a big ego but I also don’t want someone who is just going to coast.  Someone who sees the job as just one step of many in their overall career that demonstrates a willingness to learn and grow in the role and will want to stretch themselves.

Firstly each room has at least one Hue Dimmer Switch (4 buttons). Each button can be pressed multiple times AND held down meaning you can call up to 16 scenes from every single switch, which can be just the room you are in, the whole floor or the whole house. 

When I arrive home after sunset, the outside lights automatically come on for 3 minutes to make it easier to get into the house, plus the hallway and kitchen lights come on so I can see where I’m going if I have my hands full of shopping or something. 

Each bulb is individually programmed. I have 16 downlights in my kitchen/diner, plus a table pendant, under and over cabinet light strips and floor level strips. It means the kitchen can be a bright practical space or a chilled relaxed space sat around the table, with certain areas ‘spot lit’ and colour flooded ceiling and floor.

I have a motion sensor on the landing. If our kid (or us) gets up for a wee in the night, it automatically turns on the bathroom lights to a very low pink colour so we can see the way, but not be blinded while half asleep. 

Along with Alexa our school morning wakeup routines are automated with announcements of the days calendar, gradually increasing light brightness and music. 

I also have various sockets doing things like turning on the wax melt as we arrive home so it smells nice, Christmas Tree lights, heated blankets for bedtime yada yada.

Many of the rules in the Code are legal requirements, and if you disobey these rules you are committing a criminal offence. You may be fined, given penalty points on your licence or be disqualified from driving. In the most serious cases you may be sent to prison. Such rules are identified by the use of the words ‘MUST/MUST NOT’. In addition, the rule includes an abbreviated reference to the legislation which creates the offence. See an explanation of the abbreviations.

Although failure to comply with the other rules of the Code will not, in itself, cause a person to be prosecuted, The Highway Code may be used in evidence in any court proceedings under the Traffic Acts (see The road user and the law) to establish liability. This includes rules which use advisory wording such as ‘should/should not’ or ‘do/do not’.

Look at the very start of his career. He makes Alien, Blade Runner and Thelma and Louise between 1979 and 1991. That's three absolute classics in just over a decade, which is incredibly good going. But he also finds time in there to make Legend, Someone to Watch Over Me and Black Rain.

Teucheter,kch7ahf,18dduhw,"I worked for Ladbrokes & Coral for 3 years some of my thoughts from working for them. 

1.  There is a real understanding that gambling addiction is an issue but there are flaws in how the systems work for supporting it. At the moment if you want to ‘block’ yourself from all shops it’s impossible as the way you get added to the block list is a picture and information added to a big book which is impossible to check as it’s thousands of people in it. 

One of the projects we were working on was using facial recognition cameras in the shop entrance to pickup and flag to the staff those who were on the block list. This at the time I left never got implemented due to concerns over privacy of customers.  Even this wouldn’t go far enough as it wouldn’t stop the customer walking to a non L&C shop and betting.  

What needs to happen is that the governing body needs to mandate this across all shops and all shops access a single DB of blocked customers but I doubt that will ever happen as a lot of the other companies neglect their retail estate. 

2.  There are a lot of unprofitable shops out there, in some cases it’s about the brand being visible where a competitor is more than profit.  There are also shops which are left open for a handful of VIP customers whom in some cases even have dedicated phones in the shop. 

3. One thing that Entain (owner of ladbrokes and Coral) were implanting was moving off being jersey sponsors for football, I think they replace themselves with a charity for the rest of their sponsorship.  I’m not a football fan but they might even have stopped running Ads but don’t hold me to that. 

4. People with the least money are the ones who spend the most, it was disgusting to go to certain stores and see how much a deprived area is over run with betting shops. I think it as Barking that had 12 betting shops between the station and the old office there which was <5 min walk. 

As in point 2 these streets are flooded with shops for brand recognition and customer loyalty to avoid the customers moving to a new brand. 

5. The FOBT changes were so late in being implemented, not only for the amount of money addicts were putting in but how often it was being used to wash money.  This was IMO a big failure to allow this to go unchecked, a big reason there is so many addicts are related to these machines.",AskUK,2023-12-08T08:16:46+00:00,2023-12-08T08:16:57.333045+00:00

I may occasionally get something from my siblings but it's usually something small.

Your siblings seem rather entitled, they know you can't really afford things yet they're expecting you to spend money on their kids whilst they don't actually spend any money on you? I would personally see a day out as a great gift, like take the kids to a theme park or something, that's an amazing gift that they'll remember and enjoy, a bit more than a box of chocolates. Plus then you get to enjoy it yourself, and you get time with your nieces and nephews. And they're only open for half of the year so it allows you to have a bit more financial security. I know it sucks to feel like you're taking it out on the kids because your siblings are dickheads about it, but if you're still seeing the kids then that's the only important thing.

MrNippyNippy,kch8kcs,18d58cm,"As someone who buys silly cars personally I’d say yes 100%. 

Mainly known as “gap” insurance it means you’ll not be left in the shit if your car is stolen/written off etc. One new cars the difference between what you paid/what you owe and what the insurance company will give you can be massive. 

There’s a couple of types, you can have a policy that covers the difference between outstanding finance and the write off amount or you can have one that pays the difference between what you paid and the write off amount. 

Personally I always take “return to invoice” type (ie back to what you paid) as it allows you to get back to where you were. 

It’s not expensive if you shop around. From memory 3 years on a 40k used approved car was £300.

There's social gambling, ie playing a game of poker with some friends and enjoying a few beers, maybe going to the pub with some friends to watch the grand national. The point being, the gambling element is secondary, the primary element is enjoying a pass time with friends in a social setting. Then there's the problem gambling, gambling alone, online gambling, regular routine sporting events, that sort of thing.

YourOldPalWill,kch8uth,18cwhi3,"I wouldn't say that I want tax and banking lessons specifically. But you could easily change English lessons to incorporate lessons about how to add value to your writing and how to write for job applications. Oral exams for mock interviews ect. 

As someone who has made it to postgraduate education the state school system in the UK fails children. It doesn't teach them how to sell themselves, what employers are looking for in candidates or how your writing needs to change massively to suit your audience and what that audience wants out of your writing. 

Same could be done with maths for better more practical lessons that more people would use. 

I would never for a second drop PE, history or art. Those all have tremendous value. I would just change other core lessons.

I think more practical lessons are incredibly important because atm kids are made to pick what they want with no real world experience and then are carted off to uni or a college or employment to do the same things for 45 years until they die.

mydonna,kch90vg,18de13t,"I moved to the UK four years ago to study and I loved it, partly because I had been reading Agatha Christie and was interested in the same thing you're asking. The short answer is yes, they do exist and they are lovely.

The long answer is, when you watch or read about events happening somewhere you've never been, your brain tends to fill in the gaps with what it already knows, but slightly adjusted to what it expects. For example, I'm from a country where people (as I remember it in my childhood) idealise Western Europe and the UK as big, successful countries, but also have this expectation that London is full of smoke, fog and men in top hats, so, when I finally visited London for the first time, I was quite surprised to find idyllic places in there as well. 

You can see plenty of idyllic villages if you visit, but they might not be ""ideal"" as in the exact way you imagine them. I knew quite a lot of people who also moved to the UK to study but couldn't reconcile their expectations and the reality they were faced with. 

Of course, people are different and I have no idea what you're like, but I thought I should share my experience on the off chance it's relevant to you.",AskUK,2023-12-08T08:40:32+00:00,2023-12-08T08:40:43.724118+00:00

BarraDoner,kch92bs,18d4s1h,"It seems to be a psychological thing that is true in many parts of life that people treat those they see as weaker than them with more aggression. If you think back to unsolicited confrontations you’ve had in your life; the majority of them will have been instigated by someone who had a significant amount of perceived power over you (higher up at work, someone physically stronger, someone in a superior social position). 

This pattern of behaviour is visible on our roads with those seen as less likely to be powerful getting treated with aggression. People with smaller cars or with L/P plates are stereotypically more likely to be someone who is younger or a woman… an aggressive person is more likely to fancy their chances of dominating someone like that so they don’t hesitate to be a dick. If they were just as frustrated with another driver who was in something like a white van they are more likely to hold back on their twatish behaviour because they feel there is a greater risk the driver might be a physical threat should a confrontation escalate. Though a big difference between aggression on the roads and other parts of life is more people feel invincible when they are in their car, so you will get a higher number of people taking risks with who they are aggressive with; I know a few people who wouldn’t say boo to a goose in day-to-day life but feel like Ronnie Pickering the moment they’re behind the wheel.",AskUK,2023-12-08T08:41:06+00:00,2023-12-08T08:41:19.281489+00:00

Ebeneezer_G00de,kcha4xq,18d3pxd,"The one job I had that paid the most was working in mental health at one stage running shifts as nurse in charge of a facility for adolescents with mental health issues. The kids were considerably easier to deal with than some of the staff including a manager whom I now realise was a complete sociopath. It took an enormous toll on my mental health and to anyone thinking of going into nursing as a career I would say, DON'T. The bloated NHS bureaucracy of managers outside auditors and a vindictive HR department will finish off anyone who has a shred of compassion.

Most enjoyable is what I do now independent english language teacher. Hourly pay rate sounds good but if I can't get the hours the income can fluctuate dramatically. I pick and choose to a large extent who I want to work with. Mostly adults who need english for professional or personal purposes. Some teenagers. 

It's enjoyable because the objective is to get people speaking and using english. There's also considerable variety, I've dealt with everything from business people needing help putting together presentations or just improving their confidence to teenagers who might have fallen behind at school or just enjoy learning and speaking english. I've been able to work doing summer camps in several European countries.

I suggest thinking a bit... are you someone who is better with people, or things? Or if you're somewhere between, do you go more towards people or things? 

Do you like routine and predictability, or do you prefer change? Do you get bored easily? Do you like to get totally in to something and not be interrupted or can you put something to one side to return to it later? Do you like to be outside, or inside? 

A lot of the process consists of eliminating things.  For example you might try doing something, discover it's not for you, well that isn't time wasted because at least now you can cross something off your list. It's also about finding something you are good at doing and not something you are necessarily interested in. Once I've finished with my students I switch off, totally, I have absolutely no interest in any of the theory or philosophy about teaching, I don't keep up to date with 'developments' in the field.

Dear [Hiring Manager's Name],

I am writing to apply for the Football Scout position at [Club Name/Scouting Organization], as advertised on [where you found the job listing]. My background in football scouting and talent identification, combined with a thorough understanding of the game, positions me well for this role.

In my previous role at [Previous Club/Organization], I was responsible for scouting and recommending players for youth and senior teams. My approach blends traditional scouting techniques with data analysis, ensuring a balanced view of a player’s potential. I have a track record of identifying talents who have made significant impacts in their respective teams.

Beyond technical skills, I offer strong communication abilities and a substantial network within the football community, which aids in identifying emerging talents. My experience has honed my ability to efficiently evaluate and communicate players’ potential to club officials and coaches.

Joining [Club Name/Scouting Organization] appeals to me due to [specific reason related to the club or organization]. I am confident that my experience and approach to scouting would be beneficial to your team.

I have attached my CV for your review and welcome the opportunity for an interview to discuss how I can contribute to [Club Name/Scouting Organization].

Thank you for considering my application.

Yours sincerely,

[Your Name]

And at the same time the industry claiming that they care about their customers because they have a banner ""when the fun stops. Stop."" on their adverts.

His conclusion was that It's all just a box ticking exercise. The industry does not give a single shit about any of its customers, only about making more and more money. Which we all know anyway, but the whole ""caring"" thing is such a sham.

SongsAboutGhosts,kchaoop,18d89hi,"If you buy for the kids rather than the parents, the parents appreciate you buying the presents for the kids, whereas the kids wouldn't appreciate it if you just bought for the parents. So, if you have to choose one, buying for the kids makes more people happy.

For lots of people, Christmas is about the kids. There's more excitement and magic for them, which can make it more fun for everyone, even if they aren't your kids (obviously, this does not apply to everyone). Lots of people also see kids as sort of the bright hope for the family and future, so they'd rather the kids be spoilt at Christmas/birthdays and have magical days so it can be wonderful while that's still possible. All this is probably much more relevant to kid people (not necessarily parents, but certainly people who like kids).

I think the main crux of the matter is that there's a bit of wealth inequality in your family that isn't being fully acknowledged. If you had a more than comfortable amount of money, you'd probably be much happier to spend it on the younger family members (though, to be fair, a more long-standing relationship with your siblings and nibbling would probably also help).

LuinAelin,kchb7l3,18dduhw,"Ok

I used to work in the industry dealing with the FOBTs. And it was horrible hearing the stories of addicts. Especially this time of year.

I still remember having to check some logs for a game because an addict thought he could make more money by gambling the money set aside for their kids Christmas presents.  I had to call the site up to inform them it was legitimate gameplay and legally they owed the customer nothing. 

Addicts wouldn't care if they're up or down on the machines. They'd just play until they had nothing left and then do the same thing the next day.

The addicts would also often react with anger, smashing machines or threatening staff.

The bookies also do seem to target poorer areas, promising an easy way to make more money.

The change in law that came in years ago was a good thing.  The only problem is they didn't change online gambling at the same time. That was just moving the problem out of the high street.

I do think in some ways yeah, we do have a gambling problem as a country. You can't watch sports without having gambling advertised.

Betting shops are now closing down rather than more opening though. They only opened a lot to put the FOBTs in. Now they don't make the money for the shops, those ""machine shops"" are closing down..",AskUK,2023-12-08T09:11:32+00:00,2023-12-08T09:11:45.904146+00:00

AhQZhengZhuan,kchcarj,18dgadc,"I haven't been to as many as 35 but I tend to agree with this. The US is geographically diverse, but the differences between states culturally are nowhere near as big as they appear to Americans. The US has a fairly clear and unified national identity. The biggest major fissure is along civil war lines, but I'd say many other smaller countries have similar fissures of equal or greater significance (e.g. East and West Germany are pretty different as one was a Communist State for half a century and travel between the two was banned). 

However there are country pairings in Europe where I'd say differences are comparable to potential differences between US states are maybe Austria and Germany, Czechia and Slovakia, and UK and Ireland. And maybe like... Serbia and Montenegro, and then microstates like San Marino or the Vatican are  basically Italy, Monaco is France, Liechtenstein is Germany or something, Andorra could be part of Spain's Catalan region, Luxembourg could be Belgium. 

But there aren't any 2 US states that are as different as the UK and France for instance, nevermind the difference between something like Spain and Finland or Ukraine and Italy, or Albania and Denmark.

There are some debatable ones that might appear similar but the lack of mutually intelligible language disqualifies. E.g. Norway and Sweden are quite similar but while their languages are closely related they are not fully mutually intelligible, and the fact that Sweden is an EU member while Norway is not is too significant a political difference. This also makes me hesitate to put UK and Ireland together, as they have totally different historical narratives, totally different political systems (Republic vs Constitutional Monarchy) use different currencies, and everything having Irish language translations gives Ireland a very different feel to the UK, even if the primary language is the same. People also play different sports, I don't think there's any state in the US where American football, basketball and baseball aren't the main sports, while Gaelic Football and Hurling are some of the most popular sports in Ireland but not really played in UK, conversely there are no Irish teams in the Premier League. Media consumption is also different, there is no BBC in Ireland (it is RTE) and their newspapers are different, while in the US Fox News, CNN, MSBNC etc are common in all states, as are the New York Times, Washington Post etc.

Latvia and Lithuania are superficially similar with some common history but their languages are not mutually intelligible. Portugal could theoretically be a region of Spain that speaks a different language like Catalonia or the Basque Region, but the fact is it isn't and Portuguese are more likely to be able to speak English or French than they are Spanish.",AskAnAmerican,2023-12-08T09:26:46+00:00,2023-12-08T09:27:03.830347+00:00

It's fine for you to tell your siblings you are happy to *exchange* gifts - otherwise, send them a Christmas card and leave it at that. 

I personally buy gifts for my niece and nephew but that's becasue I want to, plus my brother and SIL normally get me something (although as they aren't very organised, often it shows up some time after Christmas, which is actually quite nice, a Jan and Feb can be miserable, and an unexpected parcel showing up is a bit of a morale boost!

Speaking as a brit who has driven overseas, driving on the 'wrong' side of the road isn't too hard to get used to - you do need to concentrate a bit more, and be particularly careful when there isn't much traffic around, on smaller roads and at junctions as that's when you have fewer visual reminders and are more likely to accidentally go wrong.

Also remember that when you are driving a car with the steering wheel on the 'wrong' side you need to be extra careful about observations and knowing where your blind spots are, as you aren't sitting in the optimum position to see everything.

Enjoy your trip.",AskUK,2023-12-08T09:46:26+00:00,2023-12-08T09:46:44.543620+00:00

My family is from the Caribbean and it isn't odd for their to be neighborhood dogs that may stay outside for days at a time or come back every so often and stay with a family. I saw this to a lesser extend with goats and pigs though people wouldn't normally let those animals inside their home, but they would be welcomed in people's yards to be feed and petted.

Southern cities are more suburban sprawl and are known for their cultural (and temperature) warmth and hospitality (Houston, Dallas, Atlanta)

AdrenalineAnxiety,kchezxb,18djaa5,"I do think that if you are a parent who has plenty of income just buying one present these days would be seen as mean, if that present is something small like a doll or a car, and not like, an iPhone for a teenager.. or a console or gaming PC etc. Value/Budget definitely has to come into it, if you're already spending £500 then I think a gift and a few little sweet treats is absolutely fine.

But if we're talking dolls/a train etc. I assume we mean younger children who these days receive multiple gifts. Mainly because there is so much more availability of toys these days. There are lots of toys that benefit children and encourage development and are educational. For example I buy my son several boxed book sets - I hardly think providing a child with books to read is extravagant. Lego is both fun and educational, encourages learning and reasoning and dexterity and can even teach physics and engineering. If you can afford it why would you not want to give your child a few different things that enhance their life? But in the 50s a lot of kids didn't have their own books to read at all and educational ""toys"" weren't like they are these days.

nl325,kchf0vo,18djh1p,"First thing I did was go for a walk tbh. I'm a very irrational person and walking helps me collect my thoughts.

I lived at my mum's (who I paid rent to) for one, but the first thing I did was tell my close mates as they could have connections to help get me a job quicky (this worked btw!!) and then rang my dad for the same reason as he was more rational and calm as he had no stake in it.

Went home and after dropping the bomb to mum I IMMEDIATELY started applying for jobs - absolutely fucking anything. As well as potentially useful courses.

Took about six weeks to get a new job (through my friends), and I told them at interview I'd been sacked for gross misconduct, they didn't care and it gave me a good leg back up into employment. I did sign on to JSA during this but only had to attend twice.

Happened again a few years later when I had moved out (renting) but I started doing delivery work as a stop gap so there was no gap in income, just an awkward conversation on job applications. That was actually more of a barrier than the first time. That took 18 months to get an employed role again.

Every_Caterpillar945,kchfopx,18djaa5,"We were 5 kids growing up. We all got only 1 present from my parents and it was worth 100max, mostly less bc we just put stuff on our wishlist and they picked one item. From my grandparents we got a bar of chocolate with 5 or 10$ inside (they had a lot of grandkids). 

We were always very happy and looked forward to it. It never even crossed our mind to demand more. Christmas was so much more to us than just gifts, it was about lightening the tree we decorated with dad, the food my mom cooked, the activities we did as a family (there was always one street with christmas windows we visited, went to the waterpark, stuff like this - and oc no school and a lot of sweets and nuts and oranges and gingerbread - oh, and the many many cookies we baked with mom). 

These are happy memories. But nowadays with my siblings having kids of their own and all meeting on christmas, its all about gifts. And it makes me kinda sad. I wonder what these kids memories of christmas will be when grown up. They have so much stuff, the gifts (even if rather expensive) don't make their eyes shine like the gifts we got made ours shine. They just already own so much, its just another thing they get. 

The best comparison i have is when my husband moved in with my dog and me and he finds him so cuddeling and sweet he gave him treats all the time. My dog loves treats and cuddles and whenever i get him a treat, his reaction was comparable with our reaction as kids to our gifts. But since he got so much treats from my husband, it wasn't really a treat anymore and the overbearing joy stopped and he got kinda meh, another treat, alright, just put it here, i will eat it later. This only changed when i convinced my husband to give him cuddles instead of treats and after a few weeks he was his old happy self when he got a treat.

watsee,kchg57o,18cunuh,"You seriously can't get it wrong. But, here's a quick step by step;

* Check-in for your flight online beforehand. You can get your boarding pass straight to your phone, which makes things easier.
* Get to the airport at least 2 hours before you fly. Although follow your flight guidance as some recommend 3 hours. 
* Are you checking-in bags? As in, are you handing bags over to pick up at the other side? (You have to do this with large suitcases) If you are, go to the check-in desk for the airline you're flying with. There will be signs/screens everywhere. If you're just taking carry-on luggage, head straight for the Departures sign. 
* Have your passport & boarding pass ready. You'll probably have to pass through some electronic gates & scan one/both of these. 
* If there is a queue for security this is a great opportunity for you to get your liquids, laptop or anything else you're required to remove from your bags out & ready - so you're not fumbling at the conveyor belt and holding up the line. 
* Step forward when called, place anything removed from your bags into the plastic dishes provided. Also place everything from your pockets, your belt, wristwatch etc. You may also be asked to remove your shoes. 
* When requested, step forward through the metal detector. You may have to go into the body scanner & stand with your arms above your head while the scanner whizzes around you. If you beep, don't panic, its probably a button or something on your clothing. You might get asked to stand aside and patted down/searched with a handheld metal detector. 
* Collect your items once they have passed through the luggage scanner, take the dish(es) away to the re-packing area because the area at the end of the scanner can get very congested. 
* That's the hard bit done. You'll probably walk through Duty Free to get into the actual departures area of the airport. This is where you can relax, grab a drink, grab something to eat, browse the various shops & kill time until your flight gate is called. 
* There will be screens everywhere with all the upcoming departures & relevant information. Keep an eye on these as they'll tell you when your gate will be called. 
* When your gate is called, follow the signs towards it as soon as you can. It can be difficult to work out whether you'll get boarded fairly soon after or whether you're in for a bit of a wait. Be warned though, the gate area is literally normally a waiting area with seats & a vending machine. So if you want to get anything from any of the shops in departures; do that first.
* You might get boarded in groups or based on your row numbers, both of these are on your boarding pass. Step forward when your group/row is called, you'll have to present your boarding pass again if you haven't already done so & you'll be allowed to pass through towards the plane.
* Now, several things can happen here. You may either walk down a corridor & through a jet bridge directly onto the plane. You might have to walk outside onto the tarmac and board the plane via steps or you might have to walk outside and board a standing passenger coach which, once full, will take you to the plane.
* Find your seat, put your bag away and sit down as quickly as you can. If its a busy flight and you're not on early enough, you might be forced to put your bag into an overhead bin nowhere near your own seat; which can make leaving the plane a bit more difficult. 
* Enjoy the flight. 
* When you land, as soon as the seatbelt sign is off - most of the passengers will idiotically stand up and get their bags out of the overhead bin. Don't be tempted to join in this pointless act; there could be 15-20 minutes before the plane doors open & people are allowed to leave yet.
* Grab your bag and leave the plane. At the other end you may have to repeat in reverse the steps you took to get onto the plane. 
* Unless its a domestic flight, you'll have to pass through immigration which can take a very long time. Wait until your turn and you are called forward. Hand over your passport, you might be asked a few questions about your visit and you'll probably get your passport stamped and handed back. 
* If you checked baggage in at the beginning of your journey, you'll pass by the baggage carousels & need to wait for it to reappear. The carousels will have screens to identify which flight they're from. 
* You're done. Pass through the rest of the airport & head for your onward travel which will be clearly signposted.",AskUK,2023-12-08T10:21:03+00:00,2023-12-08T10:21:19.922089+00:00

Craft items, the pants had a character they liked on them, favourite snacks, cute hair accessories, jigsaw puzzles etc. They had lots of wee things to open and that'll like and use. Hats off to her, she's raising kids who appreciate everything they get and they'll enjoy a nice holiday together that will stay in their memories.

MisterKillam,kchhipv,18dc7u4,"Master Sergeant Raul ""Roy"" Perez Benavidez was born to a Mexican father and a Yaqui mother in southern Texas in 1935. His dad died of tuberculosis when he was two, and his mom died of the same illness when he was seven. He lived with his grandparents after that, working several different jobs to help keep the family afloat, dropping out of high school at 15 to help support his family. 

He joined the Texas Army National Guard at the age of 17 in 1952 and three years later went active duty, serving with the 82nd Airborne, but our real story begins when he applied to the US Army Special Forces.

He earned his Green Beret and was assigned to 5th Special Forces Group, and was part of the Military Advisory Command, Vietnam - Studies and Observations Group, a cadre of special operations soldiers who assisted the Republic of Vietnam against the North Vietnamese Army and Viet Cong before the US became fully involved. In 1965, he did what the doctors would consider a career-ender: he stepped on a land mine. His spine was broken, and upon being evacuated to the States, his doctors told him he would never walk again. 

But he had two things they didn't count on: his faith, and his love for his country.

He saw protesters burning flags and spitting on soldiers on TV, and a fire began to burn. That night, after the doctors had gone home, Roy rolled himself out of bed, used his face and his elbows to drag himself to the wall, and focused his love of America and hatred of communism on his toe. After several days, it moved. He then turned his fire to his feet, and days later, they moved, too. Against his doctors' orders, risking punishment, he pushed through the agony night after night to the cheers and encouragement of the other men who shared his hospital bay. Every night, he prayed and pushed and prayed and pushed. Eventually, his knees moved. Then his hips. He crawled, on his belly at first, then on his hands and knees, and just over a year later he walked out of the hospital on his own two feet, holding his wife Hilaria's hand as he did. 

The story of a man who re-knit his spine using nothing but pure grit and patriotism would be inspirational enough, but Roy wasn't content just to walk. He didn't belong at a desk, he belonged with his men. He wasn't a man, he was a Green Beret, and nothing would stop him from getting back to his team.

Nobody thought he'd heal enough to return to duty as a Special Forces medical sergeant, but nobody thought he'd walk again, either. By 1968, Roy was back in Vietnam, back to being a Green Beret.",AskAnAmerican,2023-12-08T10:39:56+00:00,2023-12-08T10:40:18.825081+00:00

MisterKillam,kchhjzc,18dc7u4,"This is where the real story begins. 

On the 2nd of May, 1968, Roy was attending mass, as he did every day that he could - he was a devout Catholic. Miles away, in the jungle near Loc Ninh, his ODA and their Montagnard partner force - an element of 21 men - came upon an NVA patrol. The locals attempted to convince the patrol to leave, but the NVA grew suspicious and opened fire. It was then that they discovered that there wasn't just a small NVA patrol with them, there was over a thousand NVA troops nearby. They'd accidentally stumbled upon an NVA infantry battalion in camp.

Immediately, all hell broke loose. The first helicopters that went out to rescue the trapped ODA were unable to land after their crews were severely wounded. Roy heard the desperate call for medical support and, being the team's senior medic, he grabbed his aid bag and boarded one of the birds that was willing to turn around and attempt another rescue. What he didn't grab was his rifle. His only weapon was the knife on his belt, but it was too late to turn back. He'd just have to figure it out once he got there.

The firefight in the clearing was so intense that the helicopter had to turn back, but Roy wasn't about to leave his men behind. He asked the pilot to go as low as he possibly could and jumped 20 feet to the ground below. He ran 75 yards across open ground to reach the termite mound where his comrades were taking cover, and took rounds to the leg and head on the way there. Despite having been shot in the face, he took charge of the situation, coordinating covering fire to allow a medevac bird to land and extract some of the wounded and dead. He personally dragged every wounded soldier, American and Montagnard, to safety.

At one point, a grenade exploded in front of him, filling him with shrapnel, but he had a duty to the men on his left and his right. He was stabbed in the chest with a bayonet, to which he responded ""no you"" and stabbed his attacker to death, taking the rifle out of his chest and using it to lay down covering fire. He ran back and forth, pulling as many as he could into cover and toward the helicopters.

When the communications sergeant was killed, he took the radio and directed bombing runs on the NVA positions around the clearing. When a helicopter crashed, he viciously defended the crew and helped them from the burning wreck. For six straight hours he fought, not allowing anyone to put him on a helicopter until he had secured all of the sensitive documents that the team had been carrying and made sure, one last time, that all of his fellow soldiers were accounted for. 

When he finally boarded the last bird to leave the clearing, he slumped over on the wall of the cabin. His six hours in hell were over. It was then that the thirty-seven bullet, knife, and shrapnel wounds he'd taken over the previous six hours caught up with him. Fury and desperation can only be a substitute for blood volume for so long, and his time ran out. He lost consciousness.

Later, back at the firebase, a medic identified his body, placed it in a bag, and zipped it up. But just as the zipper approached Roy's head, the corpse of Staff Sergeant Benavidez spit blood into the medic's face. It took all of the strength he had left, but Roy knew that if he got zipped up in that bag, he would never see the outside of it again. 

""Holy shit, Roy's alive"" was the cry. He was sent back to the same hospital he'd walked out of three years prior, but they knew better than to tell Roy Benavidez that anything was impossible. He didn't return to an ODA after that, but he continued to serve for another eight years, retiring in 1976 at the rank of Master Sergeant. 

They'd tried several times to award him the Congressional Medal of Honor, but the highest one could achieve without a living witness (back then, it's changed since) was a Distinguished Service Cross. Nobody could find the seven Montagnard fighters he'd saved. But there was an eighth man. Everyone assumed that the radio operator had been killed, but Sergeant Brian O'Connor was very much alive. His wounds were so severe that he was evacuated before he could be debriefed on the day's events, so his account was never formally recorded. By 1980, O'Connor was working as a fishing guide in Fiji and saw a reprinted editorial in a newspaper about Roy's story and how he couldn't be awarded the Medal of Honor without a living witness. 

O'Connor caught the next flight back to the States, and told everyone he could about what happened in that clearing near Loc Ninh. In 1983, President Reagan awarded MSG Benavidez the Medal of Honor.

Roy enjoyed his retirement, and continued to live a life in service to others. He spoke at schools about the importance of education and moral living. In the biographies written about him, he made sure that there was no swearing, because he wanted them to be appropriate for kids to read. He wrote three autobiographies, as well. He lived every word of the Special Forces' motto, De Oppresso Liber - To Free the Oppressed - and passed away from complications due to diabetes in 1998 at the age of 63.

And despite all of this, despite his heroism, his exemplary service, despite the fact that he served in both of the major tenant units at this particular base, *they still renamed Fort Bragg to Fort Liberty instead of Fort Benavidez*.

aceaka1,kchjivf,18cunuh,"This is such a nice detailed list. Let me just add on some tips:

Arrive really early if you are concerned it's your first time flying. Like at least 3 hours early. This way, you get the luxury of time and won't need to stress if there's any issues and need to be delayed. 

Feel free to also ask the check in counter (and every other staff u encounter) about the next steps and directions. It can be easy to miss out on signs because it's so overwhelming.

You can watch YouTube videos about some of the stuff at your specific airport to help you get oriented. Not everything can be filmed, but having some familiarity can help with the anxiousness.

It costs nothing to be sympathetic to people that perhaps don't have your clear fortitude and strength of will. Gambling in particular is designed to exploit the most vulnerable and desperate with the allure of life changing money, and will happily give them nothing back in return.

The first step of any issue is to communicate with the people involved. You should contact the company through all available methods, including phone, e-mail, social media, and use their complaints process (e.g., using a service like [Resolver](https://www.resolver.co.uk/)).

Not having an official language doesn't mean anything. The country is still run with English in mind, it just isn't limited to English. Being such a diverse country, having one official language seems unnecessary given what languages people can and do speak.

As for Spanish being taken over compared to English, not going to happen. Most Spanish speakers in America, speak English as well. But the vast majority of language speakers are English speakers.

Only about 12.7% of Americans (over the age of 5), speak Spanish at home. In that number, most also speak English fluently. 78% of Americans speak primarily English at home. 

More people are learning Spanish, but they also know English, and English is still the most spoken language in America, by far.",AskAnAmerican,2023-12-08T11:13:44+00:00,2023-12-08T11:13:55.456912+00:00

auldandcrabbit,kchkxru,18djaa5,"It's no different from any other form of SM, it's all about how you use it. There's a lot of crap on there but I rarely see it, the algorithm's pretty good at recommending stuff you're into. When you search something you'll get related content. I get gardening and crochet stuff, DIY and house reno, recipes and yoga, health and wellbeing etc. I'm middle aged af and my SM reflects that. 😆

The downside is if you watch a rogue vid that shows up, you will get a lot of similar recommendations for a while so I get why folk think it's full of shite.",AskUK,2023-12-08T11:24:06+00:00,2023-12-08T11:24:20.872324+00:00

stealer_of_boots,kchky6m,18dduhw,"This whole thread just reminds me of the Helmet safety bit in the Ricky Gervais podcast.

You're right, but there has to be balance when you decide to legislate something, surely? The best legislation imo gives you a significant impact whilst minimising the extent to which you inconvenience people or encroach on their choices. Seatbelts for example are great; two seconds to pop on, halves your chance of dying if you're in a crash. But as for gambling, surely people should have the freedom to spend their money as they wish?",AskUK,2023-12-08T11:24:15+00:00,2023-12-08T11:24:26.112445+00:00

Remarkable-Book-9426,kchkz7v,18djvz0,"Sure, but equally it's questionable in most cases whether your GP really fits the bill either. Clearly for many people (esp working class people) their GP is probably the only 'professional role' they routinely interact with, but even then most probably don't interact with them enough to actually be *known* by them in the sense the passport office is really looking for. Probably a relatively small subset who spend enough time with their doctor for that to be true.",AskUK,2023-12-08T11:24:37+00:00,2023-12-08T11:24:52.274650+00:00
